# SwiftUIPagingScrollView
implementation of generic paging scrollView in SwiftUI since there is not such option with SwiftUI ScrollView implementation

![Example](https://github.com/izakpavel/SwiftUIPagingScrollView/blob/master/example.gif)

This is still WIP but so far demonstrates the idea of using Hstack as a container and modifing the items offset based on the drag gesture

**Notes:**
* the drag gesture seems incompatible with Buttons, so to get tap on items tapGesture is used instead
* tested with XCode 11 beta 6
* background colors are for demo and debug purposes - will be removed once ready

**Todo:**
* cleaner interface
